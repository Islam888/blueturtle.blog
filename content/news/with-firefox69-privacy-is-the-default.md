### Block Third-Party Tracking Cookies

As mentioned in [mozilla blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/03/todays-firefox-blocks-third-party-tracking-cookies-and-cryptomining-by-default/), the new feature works behind-the-scenes to keep a company from forming a profile of you based on their tracking of your browsing behavior across websites â€” often without your knowledge or consent. Those profiles and the information they contain may then be sold and used for purposes you never knew or intended.

Here is how to see the blocked list for a website:
