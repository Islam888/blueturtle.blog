Instead of searching for icons in [Material icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline), and then trying to figure out what the required icon component name would look like, now you can directly search for any icon among 1,000+ official Material icons converted to svg icon components.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wondering how you can use the Material Design icons?<br>We are happy to unveil our new icons search directly built in the documentation üîç‚ú®.<a href="https://t.co/RoWxQ7Tib3">https://t.co/RoWxQ7Tib3</a> <a href="https://t.co/k5yCMIC7xt">pic.twitter.com/k5yCMIC7xt</a></p>&mdash; Material-UI (@MaterialUI) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaterialUI/status/1164302839033794561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The search feature is super easy. After you select an icon a pop up opens with the import of such icon. 

You can also choose between icon styles (Filled, Outlined, Rounded, Two tone, and Sharp) in the left side bar.

As announced in Material-UI [tweet](https://twitter.com/MaterialUI/status/1164303661880754177) that their _synonyms list is not perfect yet. And they will refine it based on the search usage._
