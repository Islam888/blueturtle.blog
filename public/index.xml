      <description>Instead of searching for icons in Material icons, and then trying to figure out what the required icon component name would look like, now you can directly search for any icon among 1,000+ official Material icons converted to svg icon components.
  Wondering how you can use the Material Design icons?
We are happy to unveil our new icons search directly built in the documentation üîç‚ú®.https://t.co/RoWxQ7Tib3 pic.twitter.com/k5yCMIC7xt</description>

      <title>Why We Write &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; ?</title>

      <description>Yes, this is for the absolute beginner, and also for those non-beginners who forgot. I am going to look back behinds and re-discover things we take as granted by asking &amp;ldquo;WHAT&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;WHY&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;HOW&amp;rdquo;.
  &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;! DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; is the first html tag written at the beginning of any html file. It is not an element and doesn&amp;rsquo;t has content or closing tag.</description>

      <description>ES6 has introduced some new syntax features. One of them was key words const, and let to declare variables. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why they are preferred over var.
  Scopeüî≠ var has a function scope. This means it is accessible anywhere in the function it is defined inside. See this example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  function buyHerChocolate(onDiet) { if (onDiet) { var decision = &amp;#34;Don&amp;#39;t do it!</description>
